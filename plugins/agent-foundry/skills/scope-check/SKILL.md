# Scope Check

Codex port of Claude Code Game Studios /scope-check.

Use this skill when the task matches the workflow described below. Keep the
Codex version lightweight: load `references/claude-skill.md` only when the
original detailed Claude workflow is needed.

## Codex Workflow

1. Read repository-local instructions first: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the
   nearest path-scoped instructions (`Assets/CLAUDE.md` for Unity when present),
   and any referenced project docs.
2. Use this workflow's intent, but follow Codex tool and collaboration rules.
3. Apply SOLID, Clean Code, clear English naming, dependency boundaries, and
   focused tests for new or changed expected behavior.
4. When a Claude workflow mentions a custom agent, treat it as a role reference.
   Do the work locally unless the user explicitly asks for sub-agents or
   parallel agent work.
5. For implementation tasks, make the change directly when the request is clear;
   ask only when a decision cannot be safely inferred from local context.
6. Verify with the repository's available checks and summarize changed files,
   tests run, and residual risk.

## Original Workflow Summary

Analyze a feature or sprint for scope creep by comparing current scope against the original plan. Flags additions, quantifies bloat, and recommends cuts. Use when user says 'any scope creep', 'scope review', 'are we staying in scope'.
